      <h1>Jens Olsen's clocks</h1>      
 </center>

 <p>The purpose of this site is to describe some of <a href="https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Olsen_(astromekaniker)">Jens Olsen</a>'s
   clocks, and in particular his great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Olsen%27s_World_Clock">astronomical clock</a>.

 <p>Jens Olsen was born in Ribe, Denmark, in 1872
   and died in Copenhagen in 1945.
 
 <h2>Jens Olsen's astronomical clock in Copenhagen</h2>

   clock, in several installments:

       (upcoming)
   </ul>
